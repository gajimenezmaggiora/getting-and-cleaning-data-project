# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the following files:

* CodeBook.md
* README.md
* run_analysis.R

## CodeBook.md

This file contains a complete list of variable names, definitions and units that describe the
output data file generated by executing the run_analisys.R script.

## README.md

This file describes the contents of the current repository and provides a description of the
steps applied by the run_analysis.R script to clean and transform the raw UCI HAR Dataset.

## run_analysis.R

### Description

This R script is designed to generate a tidy, analysis-ready data set from the raw UCI HAR Dataset.
The script applies the following steps:

- Merges the raw training and test data sets
- Attaches meaningful variable names based on the vector features lables described in
the features.txt file.
- Labels the activity codes using the descriptive activity names listed in the activity_labels.txt file.
- Subsets the merged data set to include only the variables associated with mean and standard deviation
  * This is done by selecting only variable names that contain 'mean' or 'std' key words.
- Creates a final data set by averaging each variable by subject and activity.  The resulting data set
is written out to the output.csv file.

### How to execute run_analysis.R

- Download and unzip the UCI HAR Dataset from the following URL:

```
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
```

  * Make sure the raw UCI HAR Data and run_analysis.R are both in your working directory.
- Execute run_analysis.R
  * The resulting data set 'output.csv' will be written in the current working directory.  A complete
  description of this data set can be found in the CodeBook.md file.
